# Website for a Socio-Economic Organization

### Git and Github workflow for this project

1. Make sure you are working on your branch/a shared branch working on the same thing `git checkout -b branch-name`. Also make sure you are always working on the most updated code in the main branch by executing `git pull origin main` everytime you want to start working so as to avoid extra merge conflicts. Also, try to keep a local copy of the files, esp the files you've changed but not pushed successfully.
2. After making changes, add all the files by staging them using `git add -A`
3. Next is committing these changes using `git commit -m "message"`. You can also do `git commit` and then use vim editor to write a commit message. Make sure this message clearly states the changes you've done broadly
4. All the above changes are for your local repo. Try to keep making multiple adds and commit each time your code is sufficiently working for your own convinience.
5. To push these changes to your branch, `git push origin branch-name`
6. If all of the above are successful, you want to come back to this repo, go to your branch, and make a new pull request. If you want, you can describe the changes you've done or any other additional comments in the description while doing that. Submit the pull request and everything will be done on your part. 

    **DO NOT MERGE THE BRANCH WITH MAIN**. If you have opened a pull request and drop me (Gitika) a message, I will be merging it.
